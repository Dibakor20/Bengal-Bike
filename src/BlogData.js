        description:"After quite some delay, Ola Electric is now set to commence the deliveries for the S1 and S1 Pro e-scooter tomorrow, December 15. The same was confirmed by the company’s CEO, Bhavish Aggarwal via his Twitter handle. In fact, Ola has also organized a special delivery event for the first 50 customers of the Ola S1 in Bengaluru. Earlier, the deliveries were supposed to begin in November but due to shortage of chipsets and electronic parts, the dates were pushed. Anywho, it’s just a day’s time before the Ola electric scooters reach their destined customers."
